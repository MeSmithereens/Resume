                        <p>Hi! My name is Alise Chanel Smith! First of all, thank you for taking the time to read over my resume, it means a lot and I appreciate it. Now a little about me; I'm currently a junior in high school at California School of the Arts-San Gabriel Valley. At school, I am currently enrolled in several Citrus College Courses, one in which I have learned all the skills to make the webpage that you are currently on. My passion truly is telling stories and entertaining people to the best of my ability. I have been in several productions, which I explore more in "Experiences!". Not only am I investing my life into media arts, I want to invest myself into society at large with the God-given skills that I have. Wherever I can help, I would love to. Wherever I can work, it would be an honor. I want to make a positive impact in all that I do and I hope that you enjoy learning more about me through my resume!
